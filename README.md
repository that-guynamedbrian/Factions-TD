# Agreement
- I reserve the right to choose who I work for, and therefore deny or discontinue any commission.
- I will work on a separate file/ copy of the game and will send either the finished asset or the place file after the completion of each task.
- I will not use AI/GPT to generate assets for my work. I can however use community modules for scripting purposes.
- Prices will be listed per task before work on the task starts.
- Tasks and their corresponding price listings will be stored in a file in a github repository owned by me.
- This agreement will be stored in another file in the same repository.
- Any changes to the agreement or price/task listing in the github repository that are pushed to the main branch by the client, and accepted by me, are considered a binding agreement between both parties. (Github code blame serves as evidence of agreement)
- Payment is per task. Payment confirmation for one task must be received before starting the next.
- In the event that either party is unwilling to continue the commission, I am due the agreed amount for all completed tasks.
- Any bugs reported while the project is ongoing as well as within 10 days post project completion will be fixed with no additional charge. (in the event that the bug cannot be fixed, the client is due a 20% return + tax on the price of that task)

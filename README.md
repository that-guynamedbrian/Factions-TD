## <ins>Deliverables & Process</ins>
- The provider is allowed to use third-party, publicly available code libraries approved by the Roblox community.
- The provider is *not* allowed to use AI/GPT to create assets and submit them to the client.
- The provider will work on a separate file/ copy of the game and will send to the client, either the finished asset*, after the completion of each task.

finished asset* : an .rbxl place file or .txt/.lua script file, ready for importing.
</br>

## <ins>Payment</ins>
- The client must pay the full amount for each task upon completion.
- Payment confirmation of one task must be received before work for the next task may begin.
</br>

## <ins>Intellectual Property Rights</ins>
- The client is transferred ownership of any created assets* following full payment.
- The provider retains ownership of any preceding assets*.
- The client is granted non-exclusive permission to use preceding assets* as they are incorporated by the provider.

created asset* : an asset created specifically for the project. </br>
preceding asset* : an asset created or acquired by the provider before the project or developed outside the scope of the tasks.
</br>

## <ins>Termination</ins>
- The provider reserve the right to choose who they work for, and therefore deny or discontinue the project at any time.
- In the event that either party is unwilling to continue working with the other, the provider is due the amounts of all completed tasks only and the client is due all the completed assets only.
</br>

## <ins>Liability & Dispute Resolution</ins>
- The provider's liability is limited to the amount paid for the specific task.
- Any bugs/shortcomings reported during the maintenance period* will be fixed with no additional charge.
- In the event that the provider fails to fix the bug/shortcoming, the client is due upto 50% of the price of that task with Roblox fees covered.

maintenance period* : the period during which the project is ongoing till 10 days after its termination.

- Prices will be listed per task before work on the task starts.
- Tasks and their corresponding price listings will be stored in a file in a github repository owned by me.
- This agreement will be stored in another file in the same repository.
- Any changes to the agreement or price/task listing in the github repository that are pushed to the main branch by the client, and accepted by me, are considered a binding agreement between both parties. (Github code blame serves as evidence of agreement)
- In the event that either party is unwilling to continue the commission, I am due the agreed amount for all completed tasks.
